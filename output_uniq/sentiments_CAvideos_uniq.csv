China. LiAngelo Ball shoplifting. UCLA. Lonzo ball vs Wizards. LiAngelo Ball expelled. Video footage of LiAngelo. Surveillance cameras. Lonzo Ball.\nLiAngelo Ball on Chino Hills isn't as good as LaMelo Ball or Lonzo Ball on UCLA. LiAngelo NBA. LaMelo Ball is not ready yet. If LaMelo continues to play this way his NBA career won't be like Lonzo Ball.\nLonzo Balls career is going to be ruined if Lavar Ball keeps talking  about Steph Curry Lavar Ball is doing too much. \nLonzo balls steph curry. Lonzo ball, UCLA player. As we all remember, sportscenter shoved as much of steph curry  down out throats as possible last season. Pre-game, during-game, post-game. Its was all steph curry, so as soon as he fucked up, or had one single bad game, we all got on him. we roasted him. the hype got to such annoying levels, that we hoped on steph curry to fail, just so we don’t have to deal with the non-stop steph curry fest. Liked it before I even watched. I agree with all of this. Lavar has been talking too much.. \nIf you guys don’t think these laker players are already annoyed the fuck out of his dad, youre as crazy as he is. Andd the quotes kinda get worse.\n\nlavar ball pointed to wat his son has done at ucla\n\n“everyone says ucla is a good team. “maaan” they had the same team last year”\n\nstill don’t think lonzos teammates might take this the wrong way? I mean I personally interpret this as, your team wasn’t shit until my son graced you unworthy peasants with his unmatched basketball savagery. Okay, now im exaggerating, but the point remains, even if what lavar is saying is the absolute truth, no one wants to hear it. Do you know how many times Jordan could have come out and said “hey the bulls aren’t jackshit without me, im the only fucking man here” you know how many times he could have said that? Not very many because he had some great fucking teams around, stop with the myths people but if he did say something like in the 80s, even though its true, its just cancerous to the team.\nLonzo Ball, Lamelo Ball, Lavar Ball\nIf lavar ball has given any indication to what he is like as a parent, its that he is onvercontrolling, and potentially over possessive. What this means is, I wouldn’t be surprised if he wants to be involved in every single thing lonzo does in the nba. And im talking money, people. Lavar would want to control what he does on the court, control what sponsors he signs with and how much they pay him, what brand deals he gets, and ofcourse his contract. In other words, I fully expect lavar ball to come out and tell lonzo “don’t even look for an agent. Now that youre in the nba, im your agent, ill make the money shots”\nLavar ball Is a looney biscuit. Hes the last person id want handling lonzos money. I mean, can you imagine lavar ball as an agent?

We traveled DEEP in Yunnan for amazing street food and to make this street food vlog in 2017! This is some of the best street food around the world! Here in Yunnan, on the ancient tea horse road in Shaxi, you can find some incredible street food delicacies.\n\nFirst off, we started bright and early for some amazing breakfast street food in China. We adventured onto the street to make this street food video and found some of the BEST snacks from the Yi and bai people of Yunnan, China. This truly is some of the most UNIQUE street food in China, starting out right away with BREAKFAST! The local street food recipes were incredible!\n\nWe tasted a few amazing dishes, bright and early!\n\nFirst up, for breakfast, we found a lady selling this incredible milk cheese, kind of like curdled milk, right on the street. You can eat it plain or you can order it fried for breakfast with a lot of sugar. We ended up trying both. \n\nThen, we walked down the street and had a nice and hearty and healthy lunch soup, and rice as well. Super tasty and delicious!\n\nThen we went for a walk and found some street huajuan rolls stuffed with fermented tofu, very strong and pungent!\n\nAll of this was found during the weekly farmers market on the street in Shaxi every friday! If you come to Yunnan in Southern China, come to Shaxi on a friday to visit one of the most amazing street markets! You have to come check it out!\n\nAfter that, we went for a lunch and tasted classic bai cuisine, including local Matsutake mushrooms and amazing salted pork, which kind of tasted like pastrami! So delicious!!\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious .\n\nI enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way!

Some in Silicon Valley are even calling for a basic minimum income provided by the government for everyone, under the assumption that work will become scarce. But many economists are skeptical of these claims, because the notion that the the economy offers a fixed amount of work has been debunked time and time again over the centuries and current economic data show no signs of a productivity boom. Fortunately, we don't need to divine the future of the labor market in order to prepare for it. \n\n///\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Suscríbete a TheRichest - Español : https://goo.gl/ogE71b\nSubscribe: https://goo.gl/Hnoaw3\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen the lid was blown off of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, it was just the tip of the iceberg. As the entertainment industry tried to deal with the aftermath, more and more women stepped forward with their claims against Hollywood’s mega-producer. Soon enough, other famous men in various industries were also accused of heinous acts against other men and women. From Ethan Kath of Crystal Castles, Oliver Stone, Michael Oreskes, and Kevin Spacey, this is 10 More Famous Men EXPOSED After The Harvey Weinstein Scandal.\n\nEven a former U.S. president was accused of acting inappropriately with women. Two different accusers came forward to expose George H.W. Bush for groping them and telling them dirty jokes during public appearances. He didn’t deny the allegations. In fact, he confirmed through his spokesman that he would sometimes touch women on the rear end and tell them inappropriate jokes just for fun.\n\nMany of these men find out the hard way that behaving improperly can cost them their lives and their livelihoods. Actor and comedian Andy Dick was fired from a movie after he licked people on set. And Mark Halperin, a TV political analyst, was terminated by NBC and lost a book and HBO deal after his alleged victims came forward.\n\nIf you’d like to hear about even more about these alleged victims and the famous men who were exposed, including Robert Scoble, Brett Ratner, and actor Jeremy Piven, make sure to watch our video. Let us know in the comments section which of these scandals shocked you the most.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheTalko\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/thetalko\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/the_talko\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more videos and articles visit:\nhttp://www.thetalko.com/"

Grace Baldridge, Nando Vila and Simone Boyce the hosts of The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below. Join TYT: https://goo.gl/v8E64M\n\nOn September 5, the blog PopFront posted an article titled “Swiftly to the alt-right: Taylor subtly gets the lower case kkk in formation.” In it, Meghan Herning writes about Taylor Swift, her single “Look What You Made Me Do,” and the accompanying music video—alongside the history and current state of nazism. Herning writes: “Taylor’s lyrics in ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ seem to play to the same subtle, quiet white support of a racial hierarchy. Many on the alt-right see the song as part of a ‘re-awakening,’ in line with Trump’s rise. At one point in the accompanying music video, Taylor lords over an army of models from a podium, akin to what Hitler had in Nazis Germany [sic]. The similarities are uncanny and unsettling.”\n\nThe article also includes a screenshot from the video placed next to a photo of Adolf Hitler. The post, which discusses Swift’s apparent lack of public political advocacy, concludes, “So Taylor’s [political] silence is not innocent, it is calculated. And if that is not true, she needs to state her beliefs out loud for the world—no matter what fan base she might lose, because in America 2017, silence in the face of injustice means support for the oppressor.”\n\nRead more here: https://pitchfork.com/news/taylor-swift-criticized-by-aclu-after-sending-cease-and-desist-letter-to-blogger/#\n\nHosts: Grace Baldridge, Nando Vila and Simone Boyce\n\nCast: Grace Baldridge, Nando Vila and Simone Boyce\n\n***\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

However, more than that, the universal language of music is a voice for the voiceless, for the forgotten, lonely, and hurting. \n\nThe music used in this video is Requiem for 3 Cellos and Piano by David Popper. We are joined by incredible pianist, Susanne Ruberg-Gordon. Videography was done by Emil Agopian www.emilagopian.com \n\nAs the Three Sisters Trio, formed by cellist sisters, Mari, Ine, and Luka Coetzee, we are inspired by the beauty of music, the glory of nature, and the potential that music has to speak a language that can transcend barriers of time, and space, and connecting people to themselves and to each other. This is the first of what we hope will be a powerful mission of change, of bringing hope and joy to the lives of audiences around the world. \n\nCheck out our website, to read more about us, our story, and our work with charitable organizations and mission partners at www.3sisterscellotrio.com and follow us on Facebook  and Instagram @threesisterstrio to see what we’re up to at and away from the cello!"

If necessary, use a knife to trim the edges and place the trimmings back on top of the butter and continue to roll into a square. \nTransfer the butter layer to the refrigerator.  \nTo roll out the dough, lightly flour the counter. Place the dough on the counter, and push the rolling pin once vertically into the dough and once horizontally to form four quadrants. \nRoll out each corner and form a 10-inch square. \nPlace the butter layer on top of the dough and fold the sides of the dough over the butter, enclosing it completely. \nRoll the dough with a rolling pin to seal the seams, making sure to lengthen the dough, rather than widening it.  \nTransfer the dough to a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour.\nRoll out the dough on a floured surface until it’s 8x24 inches. \nFold the top half down to the middle, and brush off any excess flour.\nFold the bottom half over the top and turn the dough clockwise to the left. This completes the first turn. \nRefrigerate for one hour. \nRoll out the dough again two more times, completing three turns in total and refrigerating for 1 hour in between each turn. If at anytime the dough or butter begins to soften, stop and transfer back to the fridge.  \nAfter the final turn, cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. \nTo form the croissants, cut the dough in half. Place one half in the refrigerator. \nFlour the surface and roll out the dough into a long narrow strip, about 8x40 inches. \nWith a knife, trim the edges of the dough. \nCut the dough into 4 rectangles. \nPlace the chocolate on the edge of the dough and roll tightly enclosing it in the dough. \nPlace the croissants on a baking sheet, seam side down. \nRepeat with the other half of the dough. \nBrush the croissants with the beaten egg. Save the rest of the egg wash in the fridge for later.\nPlace the croissants in a warm place to rise for 1-2 hours. \nPreheat oven to 400°F (200°C).\nOnce the croissants have proofed, brush them with one more layer of egg wash. \nBake for 15 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through. \nEnjoy warm! \n\nInspired by: http://www.finecooking.com/recipe/classic-croissants\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/33442\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network"

There are a number of factors that have lead many mainstream beauty companies to having a narrow selection for people of color — and not all of those reasons are rooted in product development. With Fenty Beauty, Rihanna is showing the industry that it’s worth investing money and time into creating nuanced products beyond the ranges of ivory, beige, and tan.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Join TYT: https://goo.gl/v8E64M\n\nJust before the stroke of midnight on September 20, 2016, at the height of last year’s presidential election, the WikiLeaks Twitter account sent a private direct message to Donald Trump Jr., the Republican nominee’s oldest son and campaign surrogate. “A PAC run anti-Trump site putintrump.org is about to launch,” WikiLeaks wrote. \n\n“The PAC is a recycled pro-Iraq war PAC. We have guessed the password. It is ‘putintrump.’ See ‘About’ for who is behind it. Any comments?” (The site, which has since become a joint project with Mother Jones, was founded by Rob Glaser, a tech entrepreneur, and was funded by Progress for USA Political Action Committee.)\n\nThe next morning, about 12 hours later, Trump Jr. responded to WikiLeaks. “Off the record I don’t know who that is, but I’ll ask around,” he wrote on September 21, 2016. “Thanks.””*\n\nRead more here: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/the-secret-correspondence-between-donald-trump-jr-and-wikileaks/545738/\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n***\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Có những kiếp người hoài công một đời để kiếm tìm và đắp xây hạnh phúc. Thế nhưng, khi gần thành hình nên dạng thì niềm vui ấy lại bị vùi lấp bởi từng lớp sóng trắng xóa. Khi đó, hằn lại trên cát chỉ còn là những bọt biển dẫu li ti nhưng bạc bẽo, đơn côi. Cát Phượng là loài dã tràng như thế. Mang chữ “Cát” trên danh xưng nhưng hạnh phúc lại đến với cô chẳng trọn vẹn. Tại “Sau Ánh Hào Quang”, ca sĩ Phương Thanh đã xuất hiện để cùng Cát Phượng nhìn lại hai hành trình yêu đầy giông tố với những điều trùng hợp lạ kỳ giữa Thái Hòa và Kiều Minh Tuấn.\n\n#tranthanh #catphuong #sauanhhaoquang\n\nSau ánh hào quang là một talkshow kết hợp kịch nghệ và âm nhạc. Trong mỗi tập, MC Trấn Thành sẽ lần giở lại toàn bộ cuộc đời của 1 ngôi sao Việt qua ba phần: tuổi thơ, thành danh và những nỗi niềm chôn giấu xuyên suốt 75 phút. \n\n\nNhấn subcribe để xem tiếp những video tuyệt vời khác: \n\n✥ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/dtpsubs\n\n✥ Website: www.dongtay.com"

'사이버사 증원, 청와대 승인' 적시 02:20\n\n김관진 전 국방부장관의 구속영장에 사이버사령부가 군무원을 신규 채용할 때 청와대의 승인을 받았다는 내용이 적시됐던 것으로 JTBC 취재 결과 확인됐습니다. 당시 군이 채용을 반대했지만 김 전 장관은 청와대의 지시로 채용 절차를 5개월 앞당겨 진행한 사실도 드러났습니다.\n\n2. 이병기 체포…남재준·이병호 영장 11:07\n\n검찰이 이병기 전 국정원장을 긴급 체포해 박근혜 정부 시절 국정원 특수활동비를 청와대에 상납한 경위를 조사하고 있습니다. 앞서 소환된 남재준, 이병호 전 국정원장에 대해서는 국고손실과 뇌물공여 등의 혐의로 구속영장을 청구했습니다.\n\n3. 남쪽으로 뛰자 40여발 사격 15:18\n\n어제(13일) 판문점 공동경비구역을 통해 우리 측으로 넘어온 북한군 병사는 군용 지프를 타고 왔고 이후 차량이 배수구에 빠져 움직이지 않자 내려서 뛰는 과정에 북한군이 총격을 가한 것으로 나타났습니다. \n\n4. '중대 발표' 예고…북·미 분수령 24:22\n\n트럼프 미국 대통령이 아시아 순방을 마치고 미국으로 돌아가 중대 발표를 하겠다고 예고했습니다. 북한을 테러 지원국으로 다시 지정하는 내용이 담길 거라는 분석과 함께 북한과의 대화책을 이야기할 가능성도 전망됩니다.\n\n5. '뇌종양 산업재해' 대법 첫 인정 29:50\n\n삼성전자 반도체 공장에서 일하다 뇌종양으로 숨진 노동자에 대해 산업재해를 인정하라는 대법원 판결이 나왔습니다. 뇌종양을 산재로 인정한 대법원의 첫 판결로 비슷한 다른 소송들에도 영향을 줄 것으로 보입니다.\n\n6. '안전 논란' 원전 인근 바닷물을… 36:44\n\n부산시가 고리 원자력발전소 앞바다에서 채취한 물로 만든 생수를 사전 정보 제공 없이 장애인이나 독거노인, 저소득층, 다문화가정 등에 수십만 병씩 제공하고 있는 사실이 JTBC 취재 결과 드러났습니다.\n\n7. '명성교회 세습 무효' 교단 내 소송 01:02:07\n\n부자 세습을 강행한 명성교회에 대해 해당 지역 목사들이 교단 총회 재판국에 세습 무효 소송을 냈습니다. 오늘은 명성교회 김재훈 장로를 전화로 연결해 교회 측 입장을 듣겠습니다.\n\n8. 곳곳 갈라져…불안한 지하철역 54:58\n\n지하철 역사 곳곳에 콘크리트가 패이고 떨어져 나간 흔적이 가득합니다. 오늘 밀착카메라는 43년째 수도권 시민들의 발이 되고 있는 지하철 1호선 역사 노후화 문제를 취재했습니다.\n\n📢 JTBC유튜브 구독하기 (http://bitly.kr/5p)\n✍ JTBC유튜브 커뮤니티 (http://bitly.kr/B9s)\n\n▶ 공식 홈페이지 http://news.jtbc.co.kr\n▶ 공식 페이스북 https://www.facebook.com/jtbcnews\n▶ 공식 트위터 https://twitter.com/JTBC_news\n\n방송사 : JTBC (http://www.jtbc.co.kr)"

The Usos soon joined the fray, followed by Cesaro and Sheamus, and the situation was transforming into an out-of-control brawl.\n\nMeanwhile, the Raw Women’s division emerged backstage and delivered a systematic onslaught upon the Team Blue ladies, as Alexa Bliss punctuated the attack with a clubbing blow to Charlotte.\n\nBack in the ring, another wave of Raw Superstars hit the ring, drawing Shane McMahon and a slew of SmackDown Superstars to join the fight, but things went from back to worse for the blue brand when Raw Commissioner Kurt Angle summoned Braun Strowman into the ring to help clean house.\n\nWith SmackDown Superstars laid out in every direction, the Superstars of Raw converged on Shane McMahon. With The Shield holding SmackDown’s Commissioner, Angle made it clear to Shane that this counter-siege will be nothing compared to Sunday at Survivor Series"

Umair believed in love and marriage but apparently not in the commitment.Extra marital affair was his one insane decision which made him divorce Marium. But for her trust and commitment in love was everything. Her heart was broken awfully and she had no trust left for anybody now. Umair realizes it later after divorcing her that he made a mistake and he still loves her. Asad is Marium’s cousin but belongs to a very lower class family. He loved her but couldn’t express it because of his status. Marium’s father asks Asad to marry his daughter for the sake of Halala so that she can go back to Umair.

Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow."

Matt takes this opportunity to pull out some of the extras from his own fridge and whip up a creative and delicious looking dish. \n\n\n\nNational Clean Out Your Refrigerator Day is observed annually on November 15th, just before Thanksgiving. This is perfect timing as you're going to need plenty of room for leftovers. For most of us cleaning out the fridge is a dreaded task. We will make excuses, find other easier chores, or even just pretend we don't know it needs to be cleaned out to avoid having to do it. However, ignoring the problem doesn't make it go away. \n\nResearch has found that National Clean Out Your Refrigerator Day was created by the home economists at Whirlpool Home Appliances way back in 1999.  It is said that they originally created the holiday to encourage people to clean out their refrigerator prior to the upcoming holidays.  At the time, the company even had a toll-free hotline that people could call in to for tips on dealing with the task. \n\nUpon opening his fridge Matt finds a plethora of items that need to be used or discarded. He pulls out hot sauce, some chives, olives, tomatoes, white onions, salami, mushrooms, a loaf of bread, wine, shredded cheese, and even a Darth Vader head. When he puts it all out on the counter in plain site and you get a good look at the pile you really see how much extra food Matt had in his fridge. His collection will no doubt cause you to ask yourself if you could pull a similar sized pile out of your own fridge. \n\nAfter accessing the ingredients at his disposal Matt notices an Italian theme emerging and decides to use his ingredients to make what he calls a hybrid pizza sandwich thing.\n\nHe starts off by combining sun dried tomato oil, white onion, capacolla, fresh tomato, pickled vidalia onions, giardineira, and red wine into to medium sized pot on high heat. He stirs this frequently as it cooks and adds in a bit of tobasco as well as the chopped mushrooms he found. Next he smashes and then dices the olives he foraged and adds them into the mix. He adds in some leftover tomato sauce as well as the sun dried tomatoes he drained the oil out of earlier. He then grates a fair amount of parmesan cheese into the newly created sauce and turns down the heat to let it slowly cook the rest of the way.\n\nWhile the sauce simmers Matt takes his loaf of bread and cuts the top off of it. He then carefully cuts out the bread from the center of the loaf creating what is commonly known as a bread bowl. \n\nIn the very bottom of the bread bowl he lays down a layer of salami. The salami has a dual purpose, the first being flavor and the second being protection. The salami is thick enough to prevent the sauce from seeping through the bottom of the bread bowl. On top of the salami he adds a good amount of the shredded cheese he purloined from the fridge and follows that up with a thick layer of the sauce he just made. He makes it clear at this point that you really want to pack that sauce in there super tight. Once he has the sauce added he tops it with an additional layer of salami. After the salami layer is done he adds even more shredded cheese to the top of it and fills the remaining space in the bread bowl with sauce. \n\nMatt recommends applying the sauce while it's still warm as this will greatly aid in melting the cheese, and trust us you want that cheese melted.  Top your sauce with one more layer of shredded cheese and add some freshly grated parmesan to it. \n\nNow that you have a 6 layer bread bowl full of delicious ingredients it's time to bake. Preheat your oven to 375' F and place this bread bowl right on your oven rack without the lid on it. You will know that your hybrid pizza sandwich thing is done when it reaches a slightly crispy, lightly browned color around the top as seen in the video. Carefully remove it from the oven, add some additional shredded parmesan to the top, garnish with chives,  and finally a bit of canola oil.\n\nThere you have it.

It looks fine to me. Way cooler than most names in the league. So why would Mr. Anunoby abandon it in favor of Oh Gee and then spell it like you're supposed to say AWGG? Is he embarrassed of his heritage or something? Too African? That would be a dumb reason. Whatever the case, I'm going to keep thinking it's pronounced how it looks until he adds some periods to that thing. \n\nOG had a great game tonight, making everyone who called him a super raw project look really dumb. Well, he's been doing that already with his passing, but now he's done it with his scoring. Normally I'm not in favor of what Casey does as coach of the Raptors, but putting OG in the starting lineup worked out quite nicely. Always good to try and surprise your opponents with secret weapons. The Rockets' scouting report on him probably consisted of approximately what I wrote in the first paragraph, and little about his basketball skills. Now they know: he can shoot threes.\n\nI wonder how Bruno Caboclo is feeling right now.\n\nAll clips property of the NBA. No copyright infringement is intended.\n\nCheck out http://downtobuck.net !"

Bebalung Kelebet - For breakfast I couldn’t wait to try a dish called bebalung, a beef ribs dish. You have to arrive at this place in the morning or they will sell out, and the beef ribs are extraordinary with sambal and rice.\nPrice - 68,000 IDR ($5.02) for 2\n\nIslamic Center Mosque - After the beef ribs breakfast feast, we walked over to have a quick tour of the biggest mosque in Mataram.\n\nRumah Makan Sukaraja - For first lunch, we headed to a restaurant known for their Lombok style nasi campur, where you can choose a mixture of different dishes all over your rice. It was excellent.\nPrice - 90,000 IDR ($6.65) for 2\n\nPasar Kebon Roek\nPantai Ampenan\n\nWarung Sate Rembiga Utama - For lunch number two, and one of the must eat Indonesian foods to try when you’re in Lombok is sate rembiga. The sate is a little sweet, but spicy at the same time, and I would venture to say they are some of the most addictive sate I’ve ever had anywhere.\nTotal price - 89,000 IDR ($6.57)\n\nTaliwang Khas Pak Udin - Finally on  to ayam taliwang, and I ordered super pedas, extra spicy. They first deep fry the chicken, then coat it in multiple layers of chili sauce, and then grill it over a ridiculous hot fire, while pouring chili all over it. The result is a grilled chicken that will change your life forever, it’s insane.\nPrice - 40,000 IDR ($2.95) per chicken\n\nSeafood Ikan Bakar 88 - Finally to end this Indonesian food tour of Mataram, I met up with a group at a street food seafood restaurant. It was great to eat and hang out!\nTotal price - about 200,000 IDR ($14.77)\n\nThank you to everything I met in this video for all your help, and thank you for watching!\n\nMUSIC: Love Me Now - https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nMain camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\n2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2wXXT8h\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nGorillapod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\nI would love to connect with you!\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/"

Holding back tears, Fallon at one point recounted a childhood memory of his mom squeezing his hand three times to say I love you.\nTonight producer, mike dicenzo said on twitter, that QUOTE Taylor was not scheduled to do our show today, but we wanted something special for the first show back, so we asked her on a complete whim, since she had been in town doing SNL. She said yes with zero hesitation.” Taylor told the show, she would sing New Year’s Day – and it was even more perfect and beautiful that you would expect. \nYes, you heard that right – the lyrics of the song actually describe the story Jimmy told about his mother.\nAnd Taylor didn’t change the lyrics for this performance, that’s what the song is. The Roots’ drummer Questlove tweeted yesterday evening QUOTE I’m just realizing Taylor didn’t readjust the song’s lyrics for tonight’s performance. But the narrative literally applies to the words Jimmy spoke of his mother. Wow. You can’t plan these things @taylorswift13 @FallonTonight\nThat kind of serendipity sends shivers down my spine. I’m so glad Jimmy’s mother was present even in Taylor’s unscheduled musical performance.  Nobody knew ahead of time what the song would be, as the producer tweeted QUOTE; She sang New Year's Day. No one had heard it. Suddenly she sings the line, Squeeze my hand 3 times in the back of the taxi. I nearly gasped. Tears. I think everyone in the audience started sobbing.\nJimmy, of course, was also profoundly affected by Taylor’s song, the producer tweeted.\n“I could see Jimmy silhouetted at his desk dabbing his eyes with a tissue. We all lost it. It was a beautiful coincidence in a beautiful performance. Hold on to your memories, they will hold on to you, \nWhat an incredibly profound and touching moment. As the producer said as well, Whatever you think of Taylor, she did something beautiful for Jimmy and our show and we’re forever grateful. And we, at Clevver, are grateful that Jimmy got to pay tribute to his mother in such a meaningful way.  How incredible is this? Let us know all of your thoughts in the comment section below.

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \n\n “Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), and Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”). \n\nPeyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. \n\n“Rampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit “San Andreas.”  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. \nThe creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (“San Andreas”), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), editor Jim May (“Goosebumps”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).

Meanwhile, Jughead (Cole Sprouse) and Archie’s (KJ Apa) friendship gets tested after Penny Peabody (guest star Brit Morgan) unexpectedly calls in a favor that Jughead owes her. Elsewhere, Betty (Lili Reinhart) and Veronica (Camila Mendes) team up to investigate someone who Betty thinks could be the Black Hood killer. Finally, things take an unexpected turn for Josie (Ashleigh Murray) when a secret admirer takes things one step too far. Madelaine Petsch and Casey Cott also star.

Guo says he’s trying to stamp out corruption and graft, but China accuses him of the very same thing.\n\nSince January, Guo has taken to YouTube and Twitter making corruption allegations against top Chinese officials. Some of them have been disproven, some can’t be proven, but some have turned out to be accurate. Guo cites the retirement of China’s anti-corruption czar, Wang Qishan, as his most recent victory. Guo alleged Wang and his family made millions in mysterious business dealings. Wang did not respond to the allegations and was never investigated nor charged.\n\nChina issued an arrest warrant for Guo but does not have an extradition treaty with the U.S., which has shown no interest in detaining him. Guo, for his part, is hoping the U.S. will grant him asylum and says he can be of use to the Trump Administration. The White House hasn’t commented on Guo’s case but his position as a dissident who may have access to insider information may make him a useful bargaining chip.\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo"

Ana Kasparian, Amberia Allen, and Maytha Alhassen, the hosts of The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below. Join TYT: https://goo.gl/v8E64M\n\n“Gene Simmons believes that women can either wear a potato sack or use their sexuality instead to gain power in the world.\n\nThe always-outspoken KISS bassist and reality television star was asked by Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford on TODAY Tuesday about recent comments to the New York Post regarding women being able to use their looks to get ahead.\n\nWomen have a choice, he told the Post. They can dress in potato sacks, (but) as soon as they pretty themselves up with lipstick, lift and separate them and point them in our general direction, they’re gonna get a response. Guys are jackasses — we will buy them mansions and houses...all because of sex.\n\nHoda and Kathie Lee asked him to explain that notion.\n\nHere's the reality,'' he told them. I am aware of the rules. I didn't create them, so you can try this yourself. I'm not saying life is fair. What I'm saying is the male of the species is visually stimulated.\n\nThat's life, and so you have power, the power of being a female, and you can access that power to make more money.\n\nSimmons, 68, writes in his new book, On Power, that the best route to influence for women is using their appearance, which Hoda and Kathie Lee disputed.”\n\nRead more here: https://www.today.com/popculture/gene-simmons-stands-controversial-comments-women-i-m-not-saying-t118809\n\nHosts: Ana Kasparian, Amberia Allen, Maytha Alhassen\n\nCast: Ana Kasparian, Amberia Allen, Maytha Alhassen\n\n***\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

'다스 비자금 수습' 지시한 MB 11:20\n이명박 전 대통령이 당선 직후인 지난 2008년 다스 비자금 문제 수습을 직접 지시한 사실을 JTBC가 단독 취재했습니다. 당시 특검이 120억 원 비자금의 존재를 눈감아 줬다는 증언도 확보했습니다. JTBC가 지난 달 단독 보도했던 다스 비자금 문건의 차명 계좌 주인 17명의 실체도 확인됐습니다.\n\n3. 불안한 여진…이재민 1500여명 26:17\n어제(15일) 경북 포항에서 규모 5.4의 지진이 있은 뒤 여진이 이어지며 시민들이 밤새 불안에 떨었습니다. 지진으로 인한 부상자가 60여 명, 이재민 1500여 명이 발생해 체육관과 교회 등에 대피해 있습니다.\n\n4. 다른 대입 일정도 1주일 연기 42:47\n지진으로 수능이 일주일 미루어지면서 당장 이번 주말로 예정됐던 수시 논술 전형을 비롯한 입시 일정이 줄줄이 밀리게 됐습니다. 일주일 동안 수능 문제지를 지키는 데에 비상이 걸렸고 학원가들은 이틈을 노린 특강 마케팅에 나섰습니다. \n\n5. 태블릿 문건이 '유죄' 결정타 52:48\n법원이 정호성 전 비서관의 공무상 비밀누설 혐의에 대해 유죄를 선고하며 JTBC가 보도한 태블릿PC 문건들이 비밀 문건에 해당한다고 판단했습니다. 재판부는 태블릿PC 입수의 적법성을 인정하고 재판에 제출된 태블릿PC 문건들이 모두 합법적인 절차에 따른 증거물임을 인정함으로써 태블릿PC 조작 주장은 설 자리가 없게 됐습니다.\n\n6. '넘어오던 때 CCTV' 공개 연기 54:57\n사흘 전 북한군 병사 한 명이 공동경비구역을 통해 귀순할 당시 우리 군이 대응 사격을 하지 않은 데 대한 논란이 이어지고 있습니다. 유엔군사령부는 관련 정황을 담은 CCTV 영상을 공개할 계획이었지만 의견 조율이 더 필요하다며 무기한 연기했습니다.\n\n7. 가슴에 묻겠다…목포 떠나기로 59:13\n세월호가 뭍으로 올라온 지 8개월 만에 미수습자 5명의 가족들이 목포신항을 떠나기로 했습니다. 해양수산부는 미수습자 수색을 종료하고 선체 조사 작업을 이어갈 계획입니다.\n\n📢 JTBC유튜브 구독하기 (http://bitly.kr/5p)\n✍ JTBC유튜브 커뮤니티 (http://bitly.kr/B9s)\n\n▶ 공식 홈페이지 http://news.jtbc.co.kr\n▶ 공식 페이스북 https://www.facebook.com/jtbcnews\n▶ 공식 트위터 https://twitter.com/JTBC_news\n\n방송사 : JTBC (http://www.jtbc.co.kr)"

Ana Kasparian, Michael Shure, and Mark Thompson, hosts of The Young Turks, discuss. Tell us what you think in the comment section below. Join TYT: https://goo.gl/v8E64M\n\nThe House passed a sweeping rewrite of the tax code on Thursday by 227-205, taking a significant leap forward as Republicans seek to enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals and deliver the first major legislative achievement of President Trump’s tenure.\nAttention now turns to the Senate, which was grappling on Thursday with another setback after a congressional analysis found that their revised tax bill would actually raise taxes on lower-income Americans within a few years.\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation projected that Americans earning $30,000 or less would see their taxes increase beginning in 2021, if the Senate bill becomes law. The committee also projected that Americans earning $75,000 or less would face large tax increases in 2027, after the individual tax cuts expire. The updated analysis stems from the Senate’s last-minute inclusion of a provision that would repeal the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that most people buy health insurance. The repeal would lead many lower-income Americans to choose not to buy insurance, and thus not claim tax subsidies that currently help them defray the costs of health coverage.\nSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, called the development “astounding” and warned that middle-class taxpayers would get “clobbered” under the latest Republican plan.”*\n\nRead more here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/us/politics/house-tax-overhaul-bill.html\n\nHosts: Ana Kasparian, Michael Shure, Mark Thompson\n\nCast: Ana Kasparian, Michael Shure, Mark Thompson\n\n***\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

The fishing line I bought was 1329 yards (3987 ft.) When the line ran out I was pretty disappointed thinking it's just dangling but the iPhone footage shows it seems to have hit something. \n\nI assume the line just kept unraveling despite the phone landing, unless it just landed on a ledge or something and actually was 4000 feet deep?

On POTUS’ order, we have initiated certain fail-safes that shall safeguard the public from the primary fallout which is slated to occur 11.3 upon the arrest announcement of Mr. Podesta (actionable 11.4).\n\nConfirmation (to the public) of what is occurring will then be revealed and will not be openly accepted. Public riots are being organized in serious numbers in an effort to prevent the arrest and capture of more senior public officials. On POTUS’ order, a state of temporary military control will be actioned and special ops carried out. False leaks have been made to retain several within the confines of the United States to prevent extradition and special operator necessity.\n\nRest assured, the safety and well-being of every man, woman, and child of this country is being exhausted in full. However, the atmosphere within the country will unfortunately be divided as so many have fallen for the corrupt and evil narrative that has long been broadcast. We will be initiating the Emergency Broadcast System (EMS) during this time in an effort to provide a direct message (avoiding the fake news) to all citizens.\n\nOrganizations and/or people that wish to do us harm during this time will be met with swift fury – certain laws have been pre-lifted to provide our great military the necessary authority to handle and conduct these operations (at home and abroad).\n\n(2nd Post) POTUS will be well insulated/protected on AF1 and abroad (specific locations classified) while these operations are conducted due to the nature of the entrenchment. It is time to take back our country and make American great again. Let us salute and pray for the brave men and women in uniform who will undertake this assignment to bring forth peace, unity, and return power to the people.\n\nIt is our hope that this message reaches enough people to make a meaningful impact. We cannot yet telegraph this message through normal methods for reasons I’m sure everyone here can understand. Follow the questions from the previous thread(s) and remain calm, the primary targets are within DC and remain at the top (on both sides). The spill over in the streets will be quickly shut down. Look for more false flags – stay alert, be vigilant, and above all, please pray.\n\n“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Love is patient, love is kind.”\n\nGod bless my fellow Americans.\n4,10,20″\n\nhttps://truthearth.org/2017/11/04/massive-intel-drops-on-4chan-by-individuals-with-highest-level-q-clearance/?wref=tp\n\nThe Official Lionel Nation Store: http://www.cafepress.com/theofficiallionelnationstore\n\nSign up for Lionel's Newsletter and Truth Warrior manifestos. http://lionelmedia.com/2015/05/04/information-is-the-currency-of-the-21st-century-lionel-2010-ce/\n\nSubscribe to Lionel YouTube Channel – http://www.youtube.com/LionelY2K\nOfficial Lionel Website: http://www.lionelmedia.com\nTwitter – http://www.twitter.com/lionelmedia\nInstagram – http://www.instagram.com/lionelmedia/\nPeriscope — https://www.periscope.tv/LionelNation/ \nEmail – lionel@lionelmedia.com\nLionel Bio: http://lionelmedia.com/about-lionel/\nLionel Nation Google+ – https://plus.google.com/u/0/117173180841470374058\nThe Lebron Law Firm Website – http://www.lebronfirm.com\nLionel Nation podcasts on iTunes – http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/lionel-nation/id1015647476 Lionel Nation podcasts on audioBoom – http://audioboom.com/lionelmedia\nLionel Nation podcasts on Stitcher – http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/lionel-nation\nOfficial Facebook Fan Page – http://www.facebook.com/lionelfanpage\nThe Lebron Law Firm Facebook Page – http://www.facebook.com/lebronfirm \nThe Lebron Law Firm Twitter – http://www.twitter.com/lebronfirm"

'다스 실소유주' 관련 첫 실명 증언 13:36\n어제 JTBC 보도를 통해, 다스 비자금 문제 처리에 이명박 전 대통령이 직접 개입했다는 증언을 한 간부사원 A씨가 실명을 밝히고 인터뷰에 나섰습니다. 채씨는 하지만 당시 특검 조사에선 '모른다'고 말할 수 밖에 없었다고 털어놨습니다. \n\n4. 지진 여파로 '살 수 없는 집' 속출 16:13\n그제 경북 포항 지진으로 피해를 입은 건물들에 대한 안전진단이 시행됐는데, 사용할 수 없는 곳으로 판명되는 건물이 속출하고 있습니다. 일부 시민들은 친척이나 지인의 집을 찾아 포항을 떠나고 있습니다. \n\n5. '수능 교실' 교체…22일 예비소집 28:11\n수능 연기로 부정 행위에 대한 우려가 커지자 교육부는 시험 보는 학교는 그대로 두되 교실을 바꾸기로 했습니다. 새로운 시험 장소 확인을 위해 수능 전날인 22일 예비소집도 다시 실시합니다.\n\n📢 JTBC유튜브 구독하기 (http://bitly.kr/5p)\n✍ JTBC유튜브 커뮤니티 (http://bitly.kr/B9s)\n\n▶ 공식 홈페이지 http://news.jtbc.co.kr\n▶ 공식 페이스북 https://www.facebook.com/jtbcnews\n▶ 공식 트위터 https://twitter.com/JTBC_news\n\n방송사 : JTBC (http://www.jtbc.co.kr)"

They patrolled the streets, blocked access to government buildings, and took over the state television station to insist….\nThis is not a military takeover of government. \n\nOnce praised as a war hero, Robert Mugabe helped Zimbabwe win independence from Great Britain in 1980. He became president under Zimbabwe’s new constitution with the support of the people. \n\nBut soon, he digressed into a repressive dictator.\n\nHe secured his power through aggression and threats, there have been reports of  state-sponsored torture and killings.\n\nAnd even though Zimbabwe is technically a democracy, there’s evidence Mugabe rigged elections in his favor. \n\nNow that Mugabe is 93 years old, and reportedly in poor health, the fight for political influence is more important than ever.\n\nAnd it’s caused a split in Mugabe’s own party, the ZANU-PF.\nOn one side we have the old guard lead by Mugabe’s sacked vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa. Like Mugabe, he fought for Zimbabwe’s independence and has a checkered past that includes human rights abuses against political opponents and ethnic minorities.   \n\n\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The Amazing World of Gumball - Writing and trying to come up with jokes is pretty hard, I should know because I’m trying to do both of those things right now. Gravity Falls - Meanwhile, in another country that doesn’t have the strictest of copyright laws , Russia, we have this pretty blatant rip-off of Gravity Falls. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has been around so long that they have a lot more than just one rip-off. Take for instance, ‘Kung Fu Dino Posse’ , which even kept the reptile and Asian fighting style in the very title. Scooby-Doo - Do you enjoy shows that feature a gang of teenagers and their talking dog solving mysteries, but are just sick and tired of watching Scooby Doo? The Fairly Oddparents - A show about a kid who gets a magic being that will grant them wishes, but every episode their wish goes wrong  and they have to fix it on their own. \n\nRocket Power - Honestly who even needs Rocket Power; that late 90s/early two thousands show about kids doing extreme sports... which is pretty much all anyone was thinking about during that time period. South Park - Ever wish that there was a show that had South Park’s art style except slightly worse, and instead of being made in America it was made in Kuwait? Block 13  is definitely the show for your bizarre taste in comedy. Adventure Time - China’s take on Adventure Time has given us the vague rip-off that is The Legend of Lucky Pie . The opening image  alone should make you very skeptical, since it features the protagonist raising up his arm on top of a mountain toward the title of the show. The Simpsons - There are dozens of different dubs of The Simpsons that air all over the world in all kinds of languages. But Georgia couldn’t just be a normal country and do that, oh no. Spongebob Squarepants - Spongebob Squarepants: one of, if not the most popular cartoon of all time. With its reputation being what it is, you just know that a rip off was bound to happen at some point."

In this Chinese street food tour VLOG, we traveled to Dali in search of the best street food around the world. We woke up bright and early to eat at a local Yunnanese halal breakfast stall and tasted some of the most deliciousand flavourful sticky rice noodles in the world. Then we made our way to a classic morning breakfast market to taste a couple unique Chinese street food specialties, and then made our way to an ancient, traditional street food area in the new city of Dali to try some more street food snacks.\n\nThe BEST thing we got to try on the street was a classic Dai style feast. You will want to try all of these delicious Chinese minority street foods! It was all laid out on a banana leaf and there were so many selections to choose from, right there on the street.  Along the way, we chatted with local people and discovered a lot of new street foods that you must try if you visit China. If you come to DEEP markets and street food areas like this, you can find tons of stuff to eat and take photos of as well, and most of the locals are really friendly!\n\nChinese street food is so diverse and there are so many hundreds of street foods to try, so we are on a mission to taste all of the best street foods around the world, and in this tea horse road street food series, we made our way from Sichuan to Yunnan in search of delicious food.\n\nThe addresses for the street food locations in this video are:\n\n1) Incredible Halal Street Food sticky rice noodles (a little spicy!) - 云南省大理市大理古城一塔路29号宏伊园\n2) Street Food market with amazing soybean starch jelly - 云南省大理市下关新桥农贸市场内\n3) Traditional, Authentic street in Old Dali with 3 different street foods - 云南省大理市下关龙尾街头\n4) HUGE Dai style Street Food FEAST - 云南省大理市下关龙尾街下关李氏烤卤\n5) Xizhou baba - 云南省大理市喜洲古镇喜洲粑粑白族饭馆\n6) HUGE Bai Style Dinner with raw pork!! - 云南省大理市下关漾濞路286号海燕饭店\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n My name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious .

LiAngelo NBA. LaMelo Ball is not ready yet. If LaMelo continues to play this way his NBA career won't be like Lonzo Ball.\nLonzo Balls career is going to be ruined if Lavar Ball keeps talking  about Steph Curry Lavar Ball is doing too much. \nLonzo balls steph curry. Lonzo ball, UCLA player. As we all remember, sportscEnter shoved as much of steph curry  down out throats as possible last season. Pre-game, during-game, post-game. Its was all steph curry, so as soon as he fucked up, or had one single bad game, we all got on him. we roasted him. the hype got to such annoying levels, that we hoped on steph curry to fail, just so we don’t have to deal with the non-stop steph curry fest. Liked it before I even watched. I agree with all of this. Lavar has been talking too much.. \nIf you guys don’t think these laker players are already annoyed the fuck out of his dad, youre as crazy as he is. Andd the quotes kinda get worse.\n\nlavar ball pointed to wat his son has done at ucla\n\nLonzo balls news shoes. Lonzo Shoes. Lonzo. Big baller brand. lavar ball.\n\n“everyone says ucla is a good team. “maaan” they had the same team last year”\n\nstill don’t think lonzos teammates might take this the wrong way? I mean I personally interpret this as, your team wasn’t shit until my son graced you unworthy peasants with his unmatched basketball savagery. Okay, now im exaggerating, but the point remains, even if what lavar is saying is the absolute truth, no one wants to hear it. Do you know how many times Jordan could have come out and said “hey the bulls aren’t without me, im you know how many times he could have said that? Not very many because he had some great teams around, stop with the myths people but if he did say something like in the 80s, even though its true, its just cancerous to the team.\nLonzo Ball, Lamelo Ball, Lavar Ball\nIf lavar ball has given any indication to what he is like as a parent, its that he is onvercontrolling, and potentially over possessive. What this means is, I wouldn’t be surprised if he wants to be involved in every single thing lonzo does in the nba. And im talking money, people. Lavar would want to control what he does on the court, control what sponsors he signs with and how much they pay him, what brand deals he gets, and ofcourse his contract. In other words, I fully expect lavar ball to come out and tell lonzo “don’t even look for an agent. Now that youre in the nba, im your agent, ill make the money shots”\nLavar ball Is a looney biscuit. Hes the last person id want handling lonzos money. I mean, can you imagine lavar ball as an agent?

So we hired a car for the day and drove there, taking some stops to eat some legendary spicy Lombok Indonesian food along the way.\n\nInaq Dellah - This is the original restaurant in Lombok to eat Ayam Rarang, what I found out is one of the greatest stews I think I’ve ever had in my life. It’s basically just a pure chili stew, made with chicken. It’s so unbelievably flavor and packed with Lombok chili spice.\nTotal price - 180,000 IDR ($13.14)\n\nTetebatu, Lombok\nWaterfall entrance - 20,000 IDR ($1.46) - We arrived to Tetebatu, and paid the small entrance fee to enter the waterfall. The waterfall was worth a visit, nothing too big, but I always enjoy walking through water on a hike to reach a waterfall.\n\nNasi Puyung at Nasi Balap Puyung Inaq Esun - One of the most legendary of Lombok Indonesian food dishes is nasi puyung. Again, we went out of our way to seek out the original. It’s a combination of fried shredded chicken, mixed with a heap of curry chili paste. It doesn’t really look that spicy, but it’s pretty amazingly spicy, I loved it.

This has been researched for more than twenty years by the speaker, and over that time an incredible realization has occurred to him – we are ‘definitely’ not alone. \n\nUFO researcher Philip Kinsella discusses the ET abduction phenomenon and alien ‘Greys’, showing what he believes these entities are, where they come from and why they are secretly abducting individuals. He draws parallels to the human soul, reincarnation, and how these beings seem to be outside the laws of creation itself. The Greys may be interested in our reproduction ability because they themselves cannot reproduce: “They yearn to recreate themselves by way of hybridisation in order to make a connection and mingle within our realm.”\n\nRecorded at Truth, Mysteries and New Frontiers (Glastonbury Symposium) 2017 http://www.glastonburysymposium.co.uk/"

As Vardy raced through on goal, the Belgian produced a crunching tackle to send the striker flying, with the home crowd instantly calling for a red card.\n\nReferee Graham Scott only produced a yellow as Kompany got away with a moment of rustiness but the captain atoned for his mistake in the 16th minute. Riyad Mahrez was set away down the right flank by Marc Albrighton, before playing a fizzing ball into the box, but Kompany was waiting at the near post to produce a strong block and send the ball behind the goal.\n\nThe visitors started to find their attacking feet as the half wore on, with Kasper Schmeichel making a great fingertip save in the 21st minute to deny Silva, before an inviting cross through the box from Leroy Sane just evaded the foot of Raheem Sterling at the back post not long after.\n\nTeam news\nLeicester made one change with Marc Albrighton coming in for Shinji Okazaki. Man City made two changes as Vincent Kompany and Gabriel Jesus replaced Nicolas Otamendi and Sergio Aguero.\nThey did eventually make the breakthrough on the stroke of half-time with a superbly worked goal. After a one-two with De Bruyne, Sterling slotted the ball to Silva down the left of the box, who in turn squared it to Jesus at the back post. The striker, who was unmarked, made no mistake in slotting home.\n\nThe second half started at a pace, with Leicester having two great chances just a minute after the restart. Vardy's effort was punched away by Ederson before Harry Maguire's shot could only find the post, but the rebound allowed Man City to break.\n\nIt was one that paid off for them too as they burst down the field, with Fernandinho setting off De Bruyne, who in turn picked out Sane down the left-hand side. He then called for the ball back having made his way to the top of the box - which the Germany international obliged - and allowed De Bruyne to curl home an exquisite shot which powered into the top corner."

There are 3.5 million professional drivers in the US, all of whom may face job displacement in the autonomous future being developed by companies like Otto, Daimler, and Tesla. But before robots take the wheel entirely, there will be a long period where truckers and artificial technology split the responsibilities of the work. The first big step toward that future comes in the form of the electronic logging device, a dashboard monitor that tracks speed, location, and a driver's schedule, and reports it to an employer or a third-party monitoring service. It has a lot of truckers worried. \n\nRead Karen Levy's work here: \nhttps://goo.gl/XHYuvv \nhttps://goo.gl/BVJWmY\n\nRead the FMCSA's report on ELD safety:\nhttps://goo.gl/ydYx1R\n\nRead the NAS report on driving fatigue:\nhttps://goo.gl/VJVZMa\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Only at T-Mobile. http://bit.ly/2iZDff8 \nMore Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nKicking off our list is Pink and her incredible performance of ‘Beautiful Trauma.’ Now, we all know Pink puts on a SHOW whenever she’s called on to perform and her performance at the AMAs was no different. In fact, I think it’s safe to say that Pink flawlessly singing ‘Beautiful Trauma’ while casually hanging off the side of the JW Marriott Hotel is her greatest performance yet. \nMy hands were sweating throughout the entire performance. \nAs incredible as Pink was, how could we forget her co-AMAs opener Kelly Clarkson?! Kelly performed her newest hit ‘Love So Soft’ and while she sounded amazing during it, the moment Kelly sang ‘Miss Independent,’ I think was the official moment the balding began. \nIt felt like it was 2003 all over again and all was right in the world. \nWhile everyone was getting lost in the moment during Kelly’s performance, Demi Lovato was literally living her best life. The cameras caught her singing along to Kelly and it was the cutest thing ever because she knew every word. \nSpeaking of cute moments, this next one goes to Niall Horan and Post Malone’s adorable bromance. When Niall went up on stage to accept his award for New Artist of the Year, he gave this ridiculously sweet shout out to his brotha from anotha motha.\nSo flippin cute. But enough fluff, we need to get down to business and talk about BTS’ debut US award show performance! The guys performed their hit ‘DNA’ and the crowd went wild. Literally. I think I saw grown men crying. \nNow that’s how you do it. All other groups should be shook because that performance was fire. Cut to Ansel Elgort looking like a proud mom during their performance. \nYou can just feel him say “you’re doing great sweeties.” \nThen there was the emotional moment when Linkin Park won the AMA for Favorite Alternative Rock Artist beating out Imagine Dragons and Twenty One Pilots, but Linkin Park made sure to thank their peers during their speech for speaking such kind words about Chester. \nThey then dedicated their AMA to Chester, his memory, his talent, sense of humor, and asked the audience to appreciate what we all have and to never take anything for granted. \nImportant words to live by for sure. \nThen one of my dear queens Lady Gaga performed remotely from DC because she’s on tour, but live from LA or DC, she killed it per usual. \nLater she won the AMA for Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and she cried, I cried, we cried together because holy well deserved. That woman is already an icon and she’s barely in her 30s. \nBut speaking of icons. My nostalgia, heart, and edges weren’t ready for the Diana Ross medley for her Lifetime Achievement Award moment. \n Now we throw the word queen out there a lot these days, but literally Diana Ross is musical royalty. She is a legend and the fact that we’re getting to witness her perform a medley of a select few of her a millions of hits as she receives the Lifetime Achievement Award is truly historical. Can I also point out that she is seventy three years old! Seventy three! What the witch craftery is going on. She looks AMAZING. \nAnd as if Diana gracing us with her presence wasn’t best moment worthy enough, then her beautiful family came up on the stage to celebrate her and her grandkids may be the cutest little gum drops I’ve ever seen. \nAnd speaking of their bomb family, can we  please all give a round of applause to Tracee Ellis Ross whoabsolutely killed it as this year’s host and I would love to see her come back to host a second time. You know whose hosted the show twice in the past? Her mama. Serious mother daughter goals. \nOk those were some of our favorite moments, but I want to hear which were yours so let me know in the comment section below and don’t forget to subscribe.

\nKhans are often tagged as brave and headstrong community in our society. But our central character Sanam Khan is a pragmatic girl; even her younger sisters consider her as a coward person and tease her with the title “Khaani”. Her one and only brother Sarim is soon to be graduated and has to share the burden of house members.
\nOn the other hand, Mir Hadi, a rich brat, short-tempered fellow and belongs to an influential family. He somehow gets the clash with Khaani’s family after an incident.
\nWhen influential offender Mir Hadi approaches Khaani’s family to settle the issue but surprisingly pigeon-hearted Khaani shows immense resistance. Mir Hadi gives them death threats, terrified them and his intimidating behavior pushes Khaani to stand like an iron wall in front of him. Khaani’s chivalry and bravery melts Mir Hadi’s heart and he falls in love with her.

Pai now plans to hold a final vote on the proposal at the FCC’s Dec. 14 meeting, the people said, and roll out details of the plans next week.\n\nPai asked in May for public comment on whether the FCC has authority or should keep any regulations limiting internet providers’ ability to block, throttle or offer “fast lanes” to some websites, known as “paid prioritization.” Several industry officials told Reuters they expect Pai to drop those specific legal requirements but retain some transparency requirements under the order.”*\n\nHosts: Ana Kasparian, Mark Thompson, Lauren Silvan\n\nCast: Ana Kasparian, Mark Thompson, Lauren Silvan\n\n***\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.
